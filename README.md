# Notion Tasks Report Generator

Hello. This is a personal project I built to help me stay organized with my Notion tasks. As someone who loves using Notion for task management but often found myself missing important deadlines, I created this tool to give me a clear daily overview of what needs my attention.

## Why I Built This

I found myself spending too much time manually checking my Notion tasks and trying to prioritize them. I needed a birds eye view to:
- Quickly identify high-priority tasks that need immediate attention
- Never miss tasks due today
- Keep track of overdue items before they pile up
- See which tasks are associated with which projects

This script helps me achieve all of that by automatically generating a clean, organized report every day. I hope it can help others who are in a similar situation!

## Features

- üìä Generates both Markdown and plain text reports
- üî• Highlights high-priority tasks
- üìÖ Tracks tasks due today
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitors overdue tasks (within last 7 days)
- üìù Includes project associations
- üîÑ Automatically archives old reports
- üìã Maintains a clean target directory

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Notion API access
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env.dev` file with your Notion credentials:
   ```
   NOTION_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   NOTION_TASKS_DB=your_tasks_database_id
   NOTION_PROJECTS_DB=your_projects_database_id
   SAMPLE_TASK_PAGE_ID=your_sample_task_id
   ```

## Usage

Simply run:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will generate two files in the `target` directory:
- `tasks_report.md`: A formatted Markdown report
- `tasks_report.txt`: A plain text version of the report

## How It Works

Here's a visual representation of what happens when you run the script:

    K --> L[Generate Reports]
    L --> M[Archive Old Reports]
    M --> N[Clean Up Old Files]
    
    N --> O[End]
    
    subgraph "Task Categories"
        J --> J1[High Priority]
        J --> J2[Due Today]
        J --> J3[Overdue]
        J --> J4[No Due Date]
        J --> J5[Older Overdue]
    end
    
    subgraph "Report Generation"
        L --> L1[Markdown Report]
        L --> L2[Text Report]
    end
```

## Report Structure

The generated report includes:

1. **High Priority Tasks**
   - Tasks marked as high priority
   - Due on or before today
   - Not marked as "Done"

2. **Due Today Tasks**
   - Tasks due today
   - Not marked as "Done"

3. **Overdue Tasks**
   - Tasks overdue within the last 7 days
   - Not marked as "Done"

4. **Additional Notes**
   - Count of tasks overdue for more than 7 days
   - Count of tasks with no due date

## Maintenance

- Reports are automatically archived with timestamps
- Old reports (>7 days) are automatically cleaned up
- Project information is cached for 24 hours
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
